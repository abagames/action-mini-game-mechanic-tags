# action-mini-game-mechanic-tags ([Top Page](https://abagames.github.io/action-mini-game-mechanic-tags/))

I have sorted the games that I have created up to this point into tags for each category, illustrating the specific types of player characters, weapons, obstacles, fields, rules, and controls that they encompass. You can find a list of these tags on the page above. To obtain a more detailed description of each tag and a list of games that are associated with it, click on the 'Detail' button for that particular tag.

I anticipate the subsequent utilities for this webpage:

- Examine the tag index page to ascertain game mechanics that could potentially be assimilated into an action-oriented mini-game.
- Peruse the tag-specific details page and contemplate alternative games that employ said game mechanics.
- Synthesize multiple tags as appropriate and generate novel game concepts utilizing the aforementioned mechanics.
